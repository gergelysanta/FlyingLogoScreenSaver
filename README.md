Project contains the same screensaver written in Swift and Objective C.

Swift version works from the TestApp but unfortunately it's not supported by the system yet. System Preferences can't load Swift libraries from the screensaver package.

Objecticve C version is fully working: both in it's TestApp and in the system itself as installed screensaver.
